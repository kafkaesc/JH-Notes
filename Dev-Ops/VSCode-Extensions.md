# VSCode Extensions

## Code Spell Checker

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker

Works well and is smart enough to check for misspellings in camelCased words. Helpful for spotting typoss early.

## ESLint

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint

Great linter that works on JavaScript, TypeScript, and JSX.

## Headwind

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=heybourn.headwind

Opinionated class ordering for Tailwind. Helpful to keep things clean, but only works when declaring `className=""`. To get the full benefits from classes declared on strings to be passed to an element you'll have to test them in a className attribute.

## Prettier - Code Formatter

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode

Opinionated formatter that helps keep code consistent easily. Set it up to run on save with the VS Code autosave tweaked to your liking. I recommend setting useTabs to true in your .prettierrc file to support [accessibility](https://twitter.com/Rich_Harris/status/1541761871585464323). 

## TODO Highlight

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wayou.vscode-todo-highlight

Basic TODO and FIXME highlighting. Helpful for organizing areas to target in your code.
